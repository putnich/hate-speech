This archive contains a morphosyntactic lexicon for Serbian that can be used in POS-tagging, parsing and lemmatisation. The lexicon was developed as a part of the ParCoLab project (http://parcolab.univ-tlse2.fr/). It was mainly extracted from the serbo-croation edition of Wiktionary (sh.wiktionary.com).

### Content description

This lexicon was extracted from the serbo-croatian version of the Wiktionary. It was built with POS-tagging and parsing in mind, so it focuses on morphosyntactic information. Each line contains a unique triple <wordform, lemma, morphosyntactic description>. The morphosyntactic tags are the ones used in the ParCoLab project. A detailed description of the tag structure and possible feature values for each POS is given in the PDF documentation downloadable from the same page as the lexicon itself.
